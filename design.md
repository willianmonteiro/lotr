# Design Overview

This document provides an overview of the UX/UI design and component reusability in the project, along with information about the project structure and the use of Tailwind CSS.

## UX/UI Design

The UI components are designed to be intuitive and visually appealing, providing a seamless user experience. The project incorporates responsive design principles to ensure optimal display and usability across different devices and screen sizes.

## Component Reusability

While the project utilizes Tailwind CSS for global styling, the components themselves are designed to be modular and independent. This means that they are self-contained and can be used in different parts of the application without introducing dependencies or causing conflicts. Each component encapsulates its own styles, logic, and functionality, making it easy to reuse them across different UI screens and features.

By designing the components to be modular and independent, the project achieves a high level of code organization and structure. Each component focuses on a specific task or functionality, making it easier to understand and maintain the codebase. Additionally, code duplication is minimized as components can be reused instead of writing similar code from scratch.

The combination of component reusability and Tailwind CSS as a global styling framework results in a codebase that is both efficient and maintainable. Developers can leverage the modular components to build UI screens and features rapidly, while the global styling ensures consistency and ease of customization across the entire application.

## Key reusable components in the project include:

- `Button`: The Button component is a versatile and reusable UI element that provides a consistent way to create buttons throughout the application. It encapsulates common button styles and interactive behaviors, such as click events and disabled states.

- `Tabs`: The Tabs component is a reusable UI element that enables the organization and presentation of content in a tabbed interface. It allows users to switch between different sections or categories of content within a single screen. The Tabs component is designed to be flexible and customizable, supporting different styles, sizes, and layouts. Optionally, the Tabs component can also include navigation functionality, allowing users to navigate to different routes associated with each tab. This enhances the user's ability to explore and interact with different sections of the application.

- `SearchInput`: A reusable input component for searching. It can be used in different parts of the application where search functionality is required. The component accepts props such as `searchQuery`, `changeFilter`, and `resetFilter` to provide flexibility and customization.

- `Card`: A reusable card component that can be used to display various types of content, such as search results, user profiles, or product details. It provides a consistent visual style and structure for displaying information.

- `Pagination`: A reusable pagination component that handles the navigation between pages of search results. It allows users to easily navigate through the available content and provides a clear indication of the current page and the total number of pages.

- `SearchContainer`: The `SearchContainer` component is responsible for rendering a searchable list of items and handling pagination. It utilizes other components and custom hooks to provide a seamless search experience.

```tsx
  import { SearchContainer } from "./path/to/SearchContainer";

  <SearchContainer
    search={{
      service: yourServiceFunction,
      property: "propertyName",
      params: { /* optional parameters */ },
      testId: "search-container" // test ID for testing purposes
    }}
    itemDisplayMapper={(filteredItems) => {
      // Map and render each item in the filteredItems array
      return (
        // JSX code for rendering each item
      );
    }}
  />
```

## Tailwind CSS

The project utilizes the Tailwind CSS framework for styling the UI components. Tailwind CSS offers a utility-first approach to styling, providing a wide range of pre-defined utility classes that can be easily applied to HTML elements. This approach allows for rapid development and customization of the UI without writing custom CSS code.
